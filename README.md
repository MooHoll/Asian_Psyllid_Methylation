# Asian Psyllid Sex-Specific DNA Methylation

This project is a collaboration with Dr. Xiudao Yu and Dr. Zhanjun Lu from Gannan Normal Universtiy, Jiangxi, China. We plan to identifiy genome-wide differences in DNA methylation between male and female *Diaphorina citri*, including the relationship of DNA methylation with gene expression and the DNA methylation differences in the sex chromosomes. This [paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15216) in aphids shows roughly what we want to achieve.

## Task 1: Determine the sex chromosome system
Summary: there is an X0 system with chromosome 08 being the X chromosome. See [here](./Identification_Sex_Chromosomes/identification_sex_chromosomes.md) for more details.

---

## Task 2: annotate TEs for later methylation analyses
Summary: TE's successfully annotated using the EDTA pipeline, see [here](./TE_annotation/TE_annotation.md) for more details.

## Task 3: differential gene expression between sexes

### To-do list:
- Differential gene expression and alternative splicing between sexes
    - Identify differentially exp genes and various standard plots
        - plot DNMT expression levels also (boxplot?)
    - Create a de novo transcriptome to better annotate alt-splice sites? (do we need to do this?)
    - Identifiy differentially alternativly spliced genes
        - check *doublesex*
    - GO enrichment for both
        - Do we have annotated GO terms? Probably not, use CrowdGO to annotate (ask Maarten if there are any issues)
    - Overlap of differentially expressed and differentially alternativy spliced 

###Â Current progress:
For up to date progress see [here](./Differential_expression/Differential_expression.md).

## Future tasks:

- Genome-wide DNA methylation differences between males and females
    - Overall levels including non-CpG (boxplots)
    - Chromosome level differences (including sex chromosomes) (I like Mather's et al. density plot better than our current one)
    - PCA clustering
    - Mean feature levels (e.g. promotors/exons etc.)
    - Counts in high/medium/low/no bins per feature
    - Exon/intron average levels per gene, **ask Rahia for code**
- Differential DNA methylation on the CpG and feature level
    - Location of differentially methylated CpGs and count
    - Relative position in gene (if enriched there)
    - MA / scatter plot 
    - Gene ontology (GO) enrichment of differentially methylated genes 
- Genome-wide relationship between DNA methylation and expression
    - Gene level scatter plots
    - Mean FPKM per binned methylation (line graph)
    - FPKM per highly binned methylation (violin plot)
- Relationship of differentially methylated genes and differentially expressed/spliced
    - General scatter of overexpressed genes and hypermethtylated genes etc.
    - Male/female biased methylated/expressed enriched on the X?
    - Overall methylation levels of differentially expressed/spliced
    - Overall expression levels of differentially methylated
