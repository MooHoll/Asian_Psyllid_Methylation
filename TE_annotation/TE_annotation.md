# Annotate TEs in the Asian Citrus Psyllid

We want to annotate TEs in *D. citri* so we can check the DNA methylation levels.

There are two ways I can do this: 

1) follow the RepeatMaskers:RepeatModeler pipeline [here](https://github.com/RossLab/Sex-Specific_Methylation_P.citri/tree/master/Transposable_elements)

2) Try a new pipeline which integrates this pipeline with others for a comprehensive identification of TEs, it also categorises the TEs which looks cool, paper [here](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1905-y) and the software [here](https://github.com/oushujun/EDTA)
