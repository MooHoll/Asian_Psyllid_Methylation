# Gene Ontology enrichment for differentially expressed and methylated genes

## Making background GO sets
Using the GO annotation file made in the genome paper, it appears there are only 5861 annotated GO terms.

This means only 338/12420 genes used in the differential expression analysis have GO terms and 10/1250 differentially expressed genes have GO terms. 

CONCLUSION: need to reannotate, look into CrowdGO.
