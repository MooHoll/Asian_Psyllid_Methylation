## Alignment to the reference genome
**Methods:** Samples were aligned to the reference genome Diaci v1.1 ([Hosmani et al. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/869685v1)) and also the lambda genome (REF?) to determine the bisulfite conversion rate using Bismark v0.20.0 ([Krueger and Andrews 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21493656/)).
